Bones for Genesis 2.0
==============

My fork of [eddiemachado's](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones-genesis) Bones for Genesis. Built for Genesis 2.0.2+ and WordPress 3.8+.

A starting point for new Genesis projects. This is a starter child theme, not a dependency. Clone it. Fork it. Hack it for your own projects. Build cool things on the web.

*Issues and pull requests are welcome and will be addressed.*

**Note: As of v2.2.0, BFG uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) instead of Codekit and [Bower](http://bower.io/) instead of Git submodules. Apologies for the extra dependencies, but I believe this is a step toward fewer compile errors and less painful project management.**

## To Get Started
You'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
git clone https://github.com/cdukes/bones-for-genesis-2-0.git genesis-bfg
cd genesis-bfg
npm update --save-dev && bower update --save
grunt
```

*All functions are prefixed with `bfg`. Do a find-and-replace to align the these function names to your project's prefix.'*
